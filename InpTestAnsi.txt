The project management plan is not a mandatory plan to pass the INL. The product description with the
external interfaces and stakeholders is not provided. Description of the strategy for design and architecture is
missing. These are the two main reasons for a FAIL.

Introduction
This project management plan outlines the approach, processes, and tools that will be
used to manage and deliver the project successfully. This plan ensures a clear
understanding of project objectives, roles and responsibilities, communication
strategies, risk management, and approval plan to guide the project toward its
successful completion.
Purpose and Scope
In this project, we focus on optimizing the thermal properties of Westermo’s industrialgrade
hardware, for example Viper-208-T4G-TBN. Ethernet switch. The goal is to
simulate, test, and optimize the product's thermal performance in a virtual
environment, ensuring that it meets the required thermal standards before physical
prototyping.
Westermo's hardware is designed to operate in extreme environments, with strict
performance requirements under harsh conditions such as wide temperature ranges,
vibrations, and electrical disturbances. The Viper-208-T4G-TBN relies on passive
cooling, as it does not have built-in fans, which adds complexity to the thermal
management of the product. Our scope will focus
on how heat is generated, dissipated,
and transferred through the product, ensuring that it can operate reliably under these
conditions.

The virtual thermal simulation will allow us to predict heat generation and dissipation
across the product. Thus, reducing the need for multiple physical prototype rounds,
saving both time and costs.
Objective List
1. Simulate the thermal performance of the Viper-208-T4G-TBN in a virtual
environment.
2. Identify potential thermal issues such as overheating or inadequate heat
dissipation.
3. Ensure the product meets industry-specific thermal standards for extreme
environments.
4. Reduce the number of physical prototypes rounds required by validating designs
through virtual simulations.

Risk Management Plan
Effective risk management is essential to ensure the smooth execution of the project
and to mitigate potential challenges that could affect the project timeline or outcomes.
Below are the key risks identified for this project, along with mitigation strategies:
Risk Monitoring
Risk Register: A
risk register will be maintained throughout the project to log and
monitor risks. Each identified risk will be evaluated for likelihood and impact, with
mitigation strategies applied as necessary.
Regular Risk Assessments: The team will conduct weekly risk assessments during
project meetings, updating risk mitigation strategies and escalating critical issues as
needed.

Objective
The task of the CM is to provide rules of versioning and storage of CI:s.
Relevant aspects in IEC 61508-1 that need to be satisfied:
5.2.9 The documents or set of information shall have a revision index (version numbers) to
make it possible to identify different versions of the document.
5.2.10 The documents or set of information shall be so structured as to make it possible to
search for relevant information. It shall be possible to identify the latest revision (version)
of a document or set of information.
5.2.11 All relevant documents shall be revised, amended, reviewed and approved under an
appropriate document control scheme.
NOTE Where automatic or semi-automatic tools are used for the production of documentation, specific
procedures may be necessary to ensure effective measures are in place for the management of versions or
other control aspects of the documents
Scope
Limitations
Currently no knowledge of required size for storage of code/models is defined.
Toolset/Techniques Implementation
Reasoning
As no DMS is available for the students in course FLA402, the functions of such a
system are emulated by specifying a workflow that the project members are required to
follow in order to guarantee compliance with IEC 61508-1.

The reason for the somewhat cumbersome procedure is that only the plain file system
in Teams is used as document repository, but anyhow the required traceability of all
CI:s needs to be fulfilled.
The Revision History section must be created manually as no DMS is available.
Usage – documents
Storage All documents are stored in MdU Teams-Files, project FLA402, where
the underlying implementation in SharePoint guarantees backup of
older versions.
Teams-Files path: Documents > General > Document Repository
All documents are stored in a linear structure as native MS Officefiles,
useful directly in the Teams tools, i.e. no sub directories are
used for categorisation.
Documents that have been replaced by a new version are moved to a
sub folder “Old Versions”.
Documents that are not any more required are moved to sub folder
“Discarded Versions.
Identification Each document has a unique file name using syntax described in BNF
below:
<document id> ::= <class nr>_<unique id nr>.<version
nr><state>_<title>.<file extension>
Where
<class nr> ::= 00…99 – a class number assigned for this class of
documents, i.e. 00 = administrative documents, such as this CM
Plan. For a list of classes, see 00_001.1W_Dokumentidentifiering!
<unique id nr> ::= 000..999, unique all over the set of documents, i.e.
the project will be limited to 1000 documents.
<version nr> ::= 1..999, i.e. max 999 versions of any document.
<state> ::= W| R | A - see note below!
<title> :: = <free text but required to be an allowed file name>
<file extension> := < as defined in Office, e.g. docx etc>
State A document may be in any of these states:
W = under Work, i.e. can be changed at any time.
R = in Review, must not be changed once it got this state.
A = Approved, typically by the QM, such a file must not be modified,
if any changed is required, the version number must be incremented.

Revision
History
See history section in the file header above!
Example of displayed version information:
Version 1.4/2 of 2024-10-09
Output Documents - Project Report
Baselines
A document baseline consists of all Approved (status A) documents in the repository
first level, as the document repository at each point in time will be a set of documents
that belong to the project. Any requirement for a baseline list can be accomplished by
listing all approved documents in the document repository first level, thus there is no
need to keep a manually updated list of the baselines.
A single baseline is expected, it will be created when the project is finished.
Change Control Board
Any change to an approved document must be requested by a formal Change Request
to the Change Control Board that consists of:
The CM
MdU/FLA402 00_003.1R_Configuration Management Plan 2024-10-09/GF
8
The QM
The SM
The CE
Before a change request is accepted an Impact Analyses must be undertaken, i.e. an
investigation into the effects on the project if the change is implemented.
Issue Tracking
A change to an approved document requires the rising of an Issue. And consequently,
an Impact Analyses of what would be the effect of handling the found issue. This is a
document stored in the Teams-Files path: Documents > General > Issue Repository
Each issue is created in a separate document named:
<Issue document file name> ::= <issue number>.<version><status>_<issue
name>.docx
where
<issue number> ::= <unique 0001...9999>
<version> ::= <1..999>
<status> ::= W|R |A|C (for Working, Review, Approved, Closed)
<issue name> ::= <free text – but must be usable as file name>
Contents of issue document – see 19_016.1W_Impact Analyses template!
When the IA generated by the IR has been handled the Change Request table in the IA
will be updated to indicate what changes that are required.
CM Audits
The project owner is invited to audit the Configuration Management at any time during
the project.
Continuous Improvement
All project members are encouraged to share their views on how the CM process can be
improved during the project.

From the revision history, it seems like this plan has been "released" without any review. But, there is a review
record that shows that a review has been done. The review record should be used to justify the content of the
release in the column "Changes/Notes" of the revision history. This also means that the released version of the
document for the INL (the formal gate) should not be draft but a first approved version.

The document shall fulfill the relevant requirements listed in IEC 61508-1.
Scope/Limitations
Valid for the whole project duration and for all project members-
The V & V Manager is responsible for this document.
Planning/Process/Approach
Two types of documents are to be created:
1. Test Description Document (TD, 20_xxx.y)
2. Test Record Document (TR, 21_xxx.y.w) NB: Double versions numbers!
NB: The first TR will have the same id number (xxx.y.1) as the corresponding TD, at
multiple tests on the same TD-version, the second version number (w) of the TR is
incremented.
Test Description (TD, 20_xxx,y)
This document is a list of all tests to be undertaken, it must contain enough detailed
information on each test so that someone else can repeat the test. The TD must be in
an approved state before any formal tests can be performed. Note that a single TD need
not cover all functionality, multiple TD:s covering different areas of the requirements
can be used to allow parallel tests to be executed.
Example of details required:
?? TD document id and version
?? Id of used SW/Modell.
?? Designations of equipment required during the test, both
apparatuses used to perform the test and any measuring
equipment.
?? Any specific requirements on the test person(s), e.g. a person
licensed to use high power equipment.
?? Each listed test must have a Unique Test Id / Number and a
reference to the applicable requirement identifier.
?? Explicit instructions on how to perform the test and how to
measure the results.
The TD is reviewed as any other document and approved by the Quality Manager, at the
review meeting the V&V manager and the Chief Engineer are mandatory reviewers.
MdU/FLA402 00_005.1R_Validation and Verification and Plan 2024-10-13/SD

At retests a subset of the TD can be defined at the CCB to limit the amount of re-testing
undertaken. As the same TR is used as template at retests, not performed test must be
marked with “No Test”. The re-test is decided by the CCB in the IA.
Test Record (TR, 21_xxx.y.w)
This document is a list of the results of all tests executed, example of details required:
?? TR document id
?? TR Author
?? Date of Test.
?? Location of Test.
?? Name(s) of test person(s).
?? TD document id.
?? Id and Version of used SW/Modell.
?? Name and Version of used equipment during the test, both
apparatuses used to perform the test and any measuring
equipment.
?? The test results are listed for each Test Id in the TD.
?? Test Summary Result:
?? OK | OK with remarks | FAIL
The TR is approved by the V&V Manager. Note that an approved TR does not mean that
all tests are successful, this is signalled in the Test Summary Result, thus also failed
tests are stored in an approved TR.
Toolset/Techniques Implementation
Traceability Matrix
Reasoning
In order to validate that all requirements have been satisfied all TR:s must be examined
and verified to have successfully results for all requirements, i.e. a cross reference from
the contents of each test in each TR to the list of requirements so any missing test is
noticed.
Usage
If the TR:s and the Requirement Specification is designed to follow predefined
structures, it would be reasonable to create an Excel sheet with macroes that can
extract this information and present it in a useful format. Of course, the work to create
this tool must be balanced with the work to create this cross reference manually.

The plan includes important subjects to manage requirements. However, there are parts that need to be
improved. The syntax to write the requirements is missed, how to achieve good quality requirements too.
These are two issues that need to be fixed before starting working with the requirements.

and implementation of requirements. Keymanagers involved include the Validation and Safety managers.
Scope
The scope is to improve the early stage of the Viper-208-T4G-TB development by
establishing a structured plan for each requirement process, ensuring quality
requirements, which are essential for an optimal virtual prototype and its validation.
Validating a good virtual protype reduces the need for creating and developing several
physical prototypes which subsequently recused time and money.
Standards
The requirements management plan is based on IEC 61508-1, ISO/IEC/ IEEE 29148 and
their included processes. The standards are applied not only to ensure that the
appropriate procedures are followed to maintain consistency and quality in the
requirements, but also to meet the stakeholder needs and achieve functional safety in
the Viper-208-T4G-TB. Further, since the product operates within a train, the RMP is
developed by considering the railway standard, BS EN 50155.
Stakeholder boundaries
In this context, the stakeholder, Westermo, necessitates valuable insights into virtual
prototyping. Additionally, the stakeholder has expressed a need for further investigation
into the heat emissions of the product. Therefore, the requirements management plan
is based on this aspect, relevant parameters concerning heat
emissions are comprehensively addressed in the virtual prototype, by the use of
models, tools and techniques provided in the plan.
Process
The process to manage quality and beneficial requirements is derived into several
steps, including requirements specification, elicitation, review, modification, validation
and verification. Important to acknowledge is that the entire process is carefully
considered in order to obtain valuable requirements regarding heat emission and the
product as whole.

Requirements Management Process
Approach
This section focuses on the approaches within the requirements activities. It covers a
detailed overview of how each stage is carried out in order to obtain the valuable
requirements for the product.
Elicitation approach
In the elicitation phase, the stakeholders are fundamental since they provide
information of what to focus on and what the expects
are. Gathering their needs is
crucial in terms of capturing beneficial requirements for the product. In this context, the
stakeholder’s needs pertain to the heat emission of the product, requiring the
identification and collection of various types of requirements to ensure an optimal
product design that manages heat effectively. The types are the following:
?? Standard Requirements: Requirements provided directly or indirectly by related
standards.
?? Safety Requirements: The safety requirements are derived by different safety
assessments provided in the safety management plan.
?? Interface Requirements: The requirements concerning how the product and its
heat shall perform in a specified environment. Derived by understanding of the
specific application and its thermal capabilities as well as using modelling tools.
?? Internal Requirements: Requirements created by the project team to ensure
the further development of the heat aspect.
?? Performance Requirements: Requirements extracted by the use of models and
simulations.

?? Reliability Requirements: To obtain continuous and optimal heat dissipation
from the product, reliability requirements are created. The requirements are
extracted from simulations and scenarios.
Specification Approach
Important in the specification phase is to categorize the requirements, which is
accomplished by utilizing the types mentioned earlier. Another crucial step is to
assemble the needed attributes within each requirement in order to obtain a complete
and well-structured specification. The attributes are the following:
?? Identification: A unique ID and name to be able to identify the requirements in
the document. The diverse IDs are in the form of Req-XXX, where X is the number
of the requirement.
?? Priority & Importance: Crucial attributes in terms of understanding which
requirements needs to be addressed first. The priority is specified with key
words such as Mandatory, Optional and Desirable. As for the Importance, the
requirements include numbers between 1 to 3, with 3 describing that the
requirement is of high importance.
?? Version: To ensure that modifications within the requirements (if approved) are
considered. The versions are listed with different numbers, with the first being 1,
then 2, 3 etc.
?? Review Status: Provides information whether the requirement has been
reviewed or not. The status is defined by the words to be reviewed, accepted and
rejected.
?? V&V Status: Describes the phase of the verification and validation in the
requirements. The status is defined by pending, pass and failed.
?? Source: The source identifies the foundation of the requirements, which may
originate from stakeholders, relevant standards, or the project team.
?? Identification Date: The date in which a requirement is identified.
Once the attributes are collected, the requirements are documented in
table form, with
the use of various tools.

particularly in the event of modifications. The following TM provides an illustration of
the diverse attributes included.
ID Unique ID
Requirement
Description
Description of the requirement.
Source The foundation of the requirement. E.g. Stakeholder,
Standards etc.
Derived From Specifies the high-level requirement.
Type Type of the requirement. E.g. Safety or performance
requirement.
Priority The priority of the requirement. Described in numbers.
Document
Specification
The document in which the requirement is specified.
Review Status Review Status.
V&V Status Verification and Validation Status.
Comments To describe further information related to the
requirement.
Review approach
To ensure that the requirements are specified with the highest level of quality, a formal
review is essential. The review is conducted using structured methodologies, including
analyzing aspects of the requirements, such as redundancy, singularity, clarity
unambiguous etc. Further, this phase is overseen by the project’s Quality Manager, who
ensures that the requirements comply with the relevant standards and procedures
outlined in the Quality Management Plan.
Verification and Validation approach
Similar to the review, the Verification and Validation (V&V) phase for requirements is
overseen by the V&V Manager, who ensures that the requirements are accurately
written to reflect stakeholder needs and provides a clear approach for their verification.
This by the use of the V&V Management Plan and its related standards.
Modification approach
To be able to modify a requirement and ensure its acceptance, a defined process is
required. The following figure outlines the steps and actions necessary for managing a
modification.

why is this field just part of the traceability matrix and not of the requirements specification itself? but,
especially, why is there a difference between requirements table and traceability matrix? to be explained!
Also, duplicate the same information twice (e.g., priority, source, etc.) is error-prone and should be avoided.

You must define a strategy to write high-quality requirements using the same standards that the quality
manager will use to check the requirements. Indeed, if you do not set a strategy to write good quality
requirements, you will not get good quality requirements, which means that you must re-iterate the review
process many times before achieving quality.

how will requirements be validated? by testing? by simulation? which requirements will undergo the
validation? to be explained. When pointing to another plan, as in this case, you must add the precise section
(number of page) of the plan (document) where it is said and add a proper reference. References to the other
project's documents are missing. To be added where necessary in the text ad in section "Standards/
References".

Safety Management Process (IEC 61508)
The Safety Management Process is a structured approach designed to ensure that systems operate
safely throughout their lifecycle. This process is divided into the key phases, each crucial to achieving
and maintaining a high level of safety throughout the entire process:
Concept and Definition
Define the safety-related objectives and outline the system's safety requirements in compliance with
SS-EN 61010-1:2010 and IEC 61508. The aim is to ensure that the system meets the necessary safety
integrity levels (SIL) and adheres to functional safety regulations for electronic and programmable
electronic safety-related systems.
Safety Objective Establish safety measures that protect both personnel and equipment during
all phases of operation, including abnormal or failure conditions.
System Safety
Requirements:
The system must comply with safety-critical requirements.

Safety Requirements Specification (SRS)
Based on the risk assessment, create a Safety Requirements Specification (SRS). The SRS outlines all
necessary safety functions that must be implemented to manage the risks identified in the previous
phase:
Functional
Requirements
Define the system's functional safety requirements, ensuring it operates within
safe parameters under all conditions.
Non-functional
Requirements
Specify additional safety-related attributes such as maximum operating
temperatures, fail-safes, or protective barriers.
Follow the steps on the Requirement Management Plan to develop the requirements.
Design and Implementation
The design phase must integrate the safety requirements defined in the SRS. All components,
systems, and processes should be designed with safety as a priority, complying with the defined
standards.
System Architecture Incorporating fault-tolerant designs and safety redundancies.
Fault Tolerance Implement redundancy and fail-safe mechanisms in critical systems
to ensure safety in case of single-point failures or electrical
malfunctions.
Implementation of Safety
Features
Installing necessary safety mechanisms such as emergency shut-offs,
warning systems, and safeguards for electrical and mechanical risks.
Tools SBD - Safety Block Diagrams
Design FMEA - Design Failure Modes and Effects Analysis
Verification and Validation (V&V)
Conduct thorough Verification and Validation (V&V) to ensure the verify that all safety requirements
are met. This involves:
Verification Ensuring that the system design matches the safety specifications outlined in
the SRS.
Validation Testing the system under both normal and extreme conditions to confirm that
safety mechanisms operate as intended.
Documentation Recording the test results to ensure traceability and support future
compliance and certification needs.
Follow the steps on the V&V Management Plan to conduct the verification.
Operation and Maintenance Planning
While operation and maintenance planning is vital for ensuring long-term product performance, it is
not applicable to this project. As the focus is solely on delivering a virtual prototype, which will not
be deployed or operated in a real-world environment, there is no need for maintenance procedures
or operational planning.

the MDU logo is too big! It seems like MDU is the most important information in this document... which is not!

The project management plan is not a mandatory plan to pass the INL. The product description with the
external interfaces and stakeholders is not provided. Description of the strategy for design and architecture is
missing. These are the two main reasons for a FAIL.

if the chief engineer ensures the technical aspects of the project, why is the chief engineer the author of the
project management plan? add it in the responsibilities.

Tables must have captions! caption is missed here.
Number: 3 Author: Luciana Provenzano Subject: Sticky Note Date: 2024-10-14 18:34:30
when a table is split in two or more pages, it is good 1) to repeat the header; 2) to ensure that the same row is
not split, as in this case.

The Configuration Management plan is very precise and its content is appropriate. ++ the clauses from the IEC
61508-1 standard concerning the configuration management. This shows that you have used the standard as
base to define the process. Very good!

From the revision history, it seems like this plan has been "released" without any review. But, there is a review
record that shows that a review has been done. The review record should be used to justify the content of the
release in the column "Changes/Notes" of the revision history. This also means that the released version of the
document for the INL (the formal gate) should not be draft but a first approved version.

(from Johan) I find the plan to be well written and motivated for the current stage. I expect there will be more
details into the specific tests in the future, but overall the plan is adequate.

The plan includes important subjects to manage requirements. However, there are parts that need to be
improved. The syntax to write the requirements is missed, how to achieve good quality requirements too.
These are two issues that need to be fixed before starting working with the requirements.

This text seems a little bit generic. It is good that you talk about the prototypes, which is the aim of your
project. However, you should explicitly mention the project's aim.
Number: 2 Author: Luciana Provenzano Subject: Comment on Text Date: 2024-10-16 15:11:41
what does it mean "introduced"?
Number: 3 Author: Luciana Provenzano Subject: Comment on Text Date: 2024-10-16 15:15:53
for a specific product OR for the thermal ... prototypes for Westermo? be more specific to your project since
this is not a generic requirements management plan but the plan for Westermo's thermal prototype.

quality, Quality: repeated twice

is Westermo the only stakeholder?
Number: 3 Author: Luciana Provenzano Subject: Comment on Text Date: 2024-10-16 15:21:59
here you could write something like that: ensuring that all requirements that capture the relevant parameters
and behaviour concerning the heat emissions are correctly managed in order for the prototype to be as much
accurate as possible.

in the text (refer to the next comment).

Introduce this figure in the text. For example, you can say: The process that is applied to manage the
requirements within this project is depicted in figure1, by providing additional explanation that helps the
reader to understand the idea.
Number: 3 Author: Luciana Provenzano Subject: Comment on Text Date: 2024-10-16 15:27:26
It is good to align the activities with the figure. For example, in Figure 1 you talk about Requirements
Elicitation. Here, you should say "in the Requirements Elicitation" phase (Figure 1)..."

can you find requirements from the standards that concern the reliability of such products?
Number: 2 Author: Luciana Provenzano Subject: Sticky Note Date: 2024-10-16 15:38:53
what about specify the requirements? which syntax are you going to use? what about ensuring the
requirements quality?

why is this attribute important? to be explained.

why is this field just part of the traceability matrix and not of the requirements specification itself? but,
especially, why is there a difference between requirements table and traceability matrix? to be explained!
Also, duplicate the same information twice (e.g., priority, source, etc.) is error-prone and should be avoided.
Number: 2 Author: Luciana Provenzano Subject: Sticky Note Date: 2024-10-16 15:51:42
You must define a strategy to write high-quality requirements using the same standards that the quality
manager will use to check the requirements. Indeed, if you do not set a strategy to write good quality
requirements, you will not get good quality requirements, which means that you must re-iterate the review
process many times before achieving quality.
Number: 3 Author: Luciana Provenzano Subject: Sticky Note Date: 2024-10-16 15:52:42
You must also specify when the review is done. You have an attribute for making a requirement ready for
review.
Number: 4 Author: Luciana Provenzano Subject: Sticky Note Date: 2024-10-16 15:57:05
how will requirements be validated? by testing? by simulation? which requirements will undergo the
validation? to be explained. When pointing to another plan, as in this case, you must add the precise section
(number of page) of the plan (document) where it is said and add a proper reference. References to the other
project's documents are missing. To be added where necessary in the text ad in section "Standards/
References".
Number: 5 Author: Luciana Provenzano Subject: Sticky Note Date: 2024-10-16 15:57:55
add the precise reference to the figure.

Use case, scenario and abuse case are not tool but methods. when are these techniques used? why?
Number: 2 Author: Luciana Provenzano Subject: Sticky Note Date: 2024-10-16 16:04:53
as far as I know the abuse cases are used to identify security requirements. Find a good reference, read it, and
reference it.

Tables must have captions and headers. Always. To be updated.
Number: 2 Author: Luciana Provenzano Subject: Sticky Note Date: 2024-10-16 16:02:52
it is not good to have an empty section. Add here the table that includes the references to the other plans
(refer to one of my previous comments) and other papers that you may need to use to complete this plan. For
example, add a reference to some papers that introduce the abuse case, the use case, the scenarios, etc.
